          Hi, I'm <b>Thu Nguyen</b>!
          <br>
          I'm a first-year Computer Science student at UC Berkeley.
          I've had experience working with Python, Java, and web development, and I
          love putting my coding abilities to the test at collegiate hackathons!
          This summer, I'll be interning at Google and working on their OMG Assist team.
